# About Me

*Passionate about diverse projects ranging from DIY electronics to web applications.*

Firmware development and actuation-related coding pique my interest.

Dedicated to mastering machine learning and developing custom ML architectures in my spare time.

When I'm not working on machine learning projects, I often find myself engaged in web development endeavors. ([Like this project I made for my friend's TTRPG](https://github.com/lokej-h/civvy-roller/).)

## I am especially good at:

- Debugging Software
- Mastering tech stacks
- Programming
    - Python
    - C/C++
- Networks and network protocols
    - DNS 
    - Firewall rules
    - DHCP
    - Debugging (nslookup, traceroute, etc.)
    - REST API's too
- Comfortable with Linux
    - At home with a terminal
- Containers and Virtual Machines [I run Proxmox for my homelab]
    - [I also wrote a script for installing Docker Engine on Windows without Docker Desktop](https://github.com/lokej-h/docker-engine-windows-install)
- Systems Architecture
    - Cloud and On-Premise Architecture for web hosting
- Using Vim
- Reading the Documentation

## I'm familiar with:

- Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) [I've made a Phase-Locked Loop in Cadence]
- PCB Board design [I usually use breadboards at home]
- Hardware Description Languages (HDL) [I like Verilog and VHDL, I just need a refresher]

## I am learning:

- Machine Learning
    - Time Series Forecasting
    - Autoregressive models
    - Autoencoders
    - LLM's [Decoder only]
    - Multi-Modal input
    - Reading research papers
- Data Analytics [I can do the math, I just need to learn how to use the math well]
